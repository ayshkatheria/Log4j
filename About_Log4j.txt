Log4j API is used for adding console, file and email level logs.


Pre-requisites:-

2. Add java mail jar

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> Import apache package for Logger class
>We can add logger configuration by using :-
  - log4j.xml file
  - log4j.properties file


log4j.xml :- "Error" have "high level priority" and "Debug" has "low level priority", meaning if we define level or
             priority in root level as error then only error logs will print in console whereas if we define priority
             as debug then every line of logs will print.

> For console logs add appender at concole level and give reference in root.
> For File logs add appender at file level and give reference in root.
Note:- define append parameter as false otherwise it will always write logs in same file
       <param name="Append" value="false"/>
